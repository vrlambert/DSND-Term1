# DSND Term 1 Projects

In this repo you will find the three projects I completed for term 1 of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. They include projected related to supervised learning, deep learning, and unsupervised learning.

### Finding Donors for CharityML

This project utilizes supervised learning on a small dataset to find potential donors for a fictional charity organization.

### Deep Learning Image Classifier

Using PyTorch and transfer learning I created an image classifier for determining flower species. Also packaged the functions into a usable script for training a model given new data and predicted a class given an image.

### Identifying Customer Segments

Dove into a large, messy real world dataset to identify customer segments. Cleaned, encoded, and engineered the necessary features to use unsupervised learning. Segmented the population and found insights on what kind of people are and are not customers of the company.
